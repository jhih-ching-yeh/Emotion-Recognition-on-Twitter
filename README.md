# Emotion Recognition on Twitter
### 13th/100+ (2022)

#### Description
In this competition, we provide a dataset which was crawled from Twitter, and we have already labeled the emotion for these tweets by some specific hashtags in the original text. There are 8 classes (or say emotions) in our dataset: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, trust, and joy.
You have to clean the data by doing some pre-processing first. Then, apply feature engineering or any other data mining technique you have or haven't learned in the Data Mining course. The final goal is to learn a model that is able to predict the emotion behind each tweet.

#### Algorithm
1. Read Data
2. Data Exploration: Hashtag>>Emotion
3. Data Exploration: Emoji>>Emotion
4. Bert Model
    - Data preprocessing
    - Using pre-trained words embedding (glove)
    - Bert Model
    - Create submition csv
5. Association Rule by Result with Hashtag, Emoji and Bert Model

#### Language
Python
